	Help on using MAP AND TRACE DISPLAY
    
    TRACE MAP(S) -- This generates one plot per map of all the traces, arrayed by 
    position in the map pattern. The multi-colored appearance has no special meaning. A 
    similar plot is also generated in which the trace-maps for all the maps are 
    superimposed. In this case the each set of traces (i.e., each map) is a different 
    color. By default, the color order is black-blue-green-etc.
    
    The settings panels let you modify the appearance of the trace map display, by 
    specifying the start and end points of the region to show, and the magnitude of the 
    offset between traces.
    
    TRACE BROWSER -- allows one to browse a map's traces. You can:
        - browse by trace number (via uicontrols)
        - browse by map location (by clicking on the slice image or map pattern)
    Note that you can reselect the slice image (R-click on axes).
