# shepherdlabephys

This is an attempt to unify the code used in the Shepherd Lab for analysing Ephus- or WaveSurfer-acquired ephys data.  Right now it consists of some very simple analysis routines, a couple example scripts, and a little GUI pulling them all together, but hopefully over time it will grow into something useful.
